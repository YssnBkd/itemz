# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Receipt Scanner feature enables users to digitize grocery receipts by photographing them with their mobile device camera. The system extracts itemized purchase data including product names, prices, quantities, and categories, then stores this information for expense tracking and analysis. This feature serves as the foundation for detailed grocery spending insights and must provide a fast, accurate, and delightful user experience.
