# Product Requirements Document - Itemz Mobile App

## Executive Summary

Itemz is a mobile application that helps users understand and optimize their grocery spending through intelligent receipt scanning and transaction analysis. We are building a focused, world-class grocery expense tracker that transforms the pain of grocery budgeting into an engaging, insightful experience.

**Mission**: Help people stop feeling ripped off at the grocery store by providing unprecedented visibility into their grocery spending patterns.

**Core Value Proposition**: Scan your grocery receipts, connect your bank account, and unlock detailed insights about your grocery spending that no other app provides.

## Market Context & Strategic Rationale

### The Problem We're Solving
- Average American families spend $5,000-8,000 annually on groceries
- Grocery spending is highly variable and emotionally charged ("Did I really spend $150 on groceries this week?")
- Existing expense trackers treat groceries as a single line item, providing no actionable insights
- People feel like they're getting ripped off but have no data to make better decisions

### Why This Strategy Wins
- **Vertical Focus**: Instead of competing with Mint/YNAB on breadth, we own the grocery category completely
- **Immediate Value**: Unlike social apps that need network effects, our app provides value from the first scan
- **Data Moat**: Every receipt scan builds our competitive advantage through proprietary SKU-level pricing data
- **Economic Tailwinds**: Inflation and cost-of-living concerns create strong demand for grocery optimization tools

### The "Trojan Horse" Strategy
The **horse** is a delightful, best-in-class expense tracker for groceries. The **army inside** is the mechanism that builds an incredibly valuable, proprietary dataset of SKU-level price information for future monetization.

## Product Strategy - Phase 1: "Single-Player Mode"

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Nail the Core Experience**: Make personal grocery expense tracking 10x better than anything on the market
2. **Achieve High Retention**: Target W4 retention >40% based on single-player value alone
3. **Build the Data Foundation**: Capture clean, structured grocery transaction data
4. **Validate Product-Market Fit**: Prove users love the core scanning and insights experience

### What We're NOT Building (Critical Boundaries)
- **Full expense tracker**: We ignore rent, subscriptions, entertainment, etc.
- **Social features**: No sharing, friends, or community features in Phase 1
- **Price comparison**: No "find cheaper prices" feature until we have sufficient data
- **Advanced budgeting**: No budget setting, bill tracking, or investment features

   - *Mitigation*: Performance budgets, continuous monitoring, optimization sprints

### Medium-Risk Areas
- Cross-platform consistency in KMP implementation
- App store approval process and policies
- Scalability of data processing infrastructure
- User privacy concerns and regulatory compliance

## Resource Requirements

## Definition of Success

Phase 1 is successful when we achieve product-market fit in the grocery vertical. Success means:

1. **Users love scanning receipts** because the insights genuinely help them understand their spending
2. **High retention** driven by single-player value, not social pressure or gimmicks
3. **World-class experience** that makes users say "this app makes me feel smart about my grocery spending"
4. **Technical foundation** ready for Phase 2 expansion (price comparison and social features)

The ultimate test: Users should be disappointed if they forget to scan a receipt, not because of gamification points, but because they genuinely want the insights about their purchase.
